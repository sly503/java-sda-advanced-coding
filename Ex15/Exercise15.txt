Create a Car enum class with FERRARI, PORSCHE, MERCEDES, BMW, OPEL, FIAT, TOYOTA etc. constants.
Each vehicle has its own parameters, e.g. price, power, etc. Enum should contain boolean isPremium() and
boolean isRegular() methods. The isPremium() method should return the opposite result to the call of the
isRegular() method.
In addition, the boolean isFasterThan() method should be declared and implemented as part of the enum
class. This method should accept the Car type object and display information that the indicated vehicle is
faster or not than the vehicle provided in the argument. To do this, use the compareTo() method.
