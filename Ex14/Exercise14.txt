Implement the following functionalities based on 100,000 element arrays with randomly selected values:
1. return a list of unique items,
2. return a list of elements that have been repeated at least once in the generated array,
3. return a list of the 25 most frequently recurring items.
Implement a method that deduplicates items in the list. If a duplicate is found, it replaces it with a new
random value that did not occur before. Check if the method worked correctly by calling method number 2.
