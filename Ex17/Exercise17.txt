Create a ConversionType enum class with the constants METERS_TO_YARDS, YARDS_TO_METERS,
CENTIMETERS_TO_ICHES, INCHES_TO_CENTIMETERS, KILOMETERS_TO_MILES, MILES_TO_KILOMETERS.
Enum should have a Converter type parameter used to perform calculations for a given type.
Then create a MeasurementConverter class that will have the convert(int value, ConvertionType
conversionType) method and based on the value and type of conversion, used the Converter of the given
type and returned the result.
