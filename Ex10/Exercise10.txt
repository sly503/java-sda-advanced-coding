Create a MoveDirection class with fields double x, double y as well as getters, setters and constructor.
Create a Movable interface with the move(MoveDirection moveDirection) method.
Implement the interface in the classes from the previous task (Point2D and Circle). When the
move(MoveDirection moveDirection) method is called, the objects are to change their position based on
the provided direction (MoveDirection).
Validate the offset by calling the other Circle methods.
