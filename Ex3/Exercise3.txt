Create a method that takes the map as a parameter, where the key is string and the value number, and then
prints each map element to the console in the format: Key: <k>, Value: <v>. There should be a comma at the
end of every line except the last, and a period at the last.
Example:
Key: Java, Value: 18,
Key: Python, Value: 1,
...
Key: PHP, Value: 0.
