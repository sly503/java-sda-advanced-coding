Create a Zoo class that will have a collection of animals and will allow you to receive statistics about your
animals:
int getNumberOfAllAnimals() → returns the number of all animals
Map <String, Integer> getAnimalsCount() → returns the number of animals of each species
Map <String, Integer> getAnimalsCountSorted() → returns the number of animals of each species
sorted based on the number of animals of a given species, where the first element is always the species with
the largest number of animals
void addAnimals(String, int) → adds n animals of a given species
