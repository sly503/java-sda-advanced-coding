Exercise 22.
Create a Fillable interface with the fill() method. Implement the method in the 3DShape class from the
previous task or separately in the Cone and Qube classes.
The fill() method should take a parameter, e.g. int, and check whether after the action of filling the figure:
• will pour too much water into the figure and overflow,
• fill the figure with water to the brim,
• not pouring enough water.
For each situation, it should write the status information in the console. Use the calculateVolume() method.
